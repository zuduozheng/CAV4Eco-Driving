    "text": "Project summary\n\n\nThis project aims to solve the paradox of trading off liveability for mobility by simultaneously reducing traffic congestion, vehicle energy consumption, and emission. This project is expected to generate fundamental knowledge and powerful tools on utilising connected and automated vehicles to help individuals become green drivers. Expected outcomes include ground-breaking models capable of holistically optimising traffic efficiency, energy consumption and emission, and innovative control strategies and policies that focus on energy efficiency and environment protection. This research will bring a wide range of substantial national benefits related to mobility, public health, environmental protection, and energy security.\n\n\n\nProject duration\n\n\nThis project started in October 2024, and is expected to finish by the end of 2028.\n\n\n\nProject budget\n\n\nThe budget from ARC is $687,578 plus in-kind contributions from University of Queensland, University of Sydney, Queensland University of Technology, Virginia Tech and MIT.\nThis project is an international collaboration involving five universities, including\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are grateful for the generous support from the Australian Research Council to this project."

    "text": "The PhD scholarship at USYD is no longer available.\nWe are seeking three additional PhD students with full scholarship to join this project: one based at UQ focusing on developing CAV-oriented control strategies using the state-of-the-art deep learning methods, one at USYD focusing on developing and testing control strategies for traffic mixed with CAV, such as real-time speed harmonisation, cooperative lane changing and ramp metering, and long-distance eco-driving, and one at QUT focusing on developing a sustainability-oriented car following model by accounting for energy consumption and emissions. The UQ position is open exclusively to domestic students, while the positions at USYD and QUT have no such restrictions. For more information about the PhD position at UQ, please contact either Prof Zuduo Zheng or A/Prof Jiwon Kim, for the PhD position at USYD, please contact Prof Michiel Bliemer, and for the PhD position at QUT, please contact Prof Lidia Morawska.\nThe first PhD scholar Mr Jiahao Zhang who will work on this DP project has joined the team.Jiahao earned his master’s degree from Zhejiang University, widely recognized as one of the top universities in China, in 2024. He completed his bachelor’s degree in 2021 through the Joint Bachelor Program between Beijing Jiaotong University and TU Delft. Jiahao is a talented young researcher with some solid research experience and a nice publication track record. He joined UQ in October 2024, and his thesis will be directly based on our DP project. Welcome on board Jiahao, and we look forward to working with you on this exciting project."
