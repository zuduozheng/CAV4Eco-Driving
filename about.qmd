![**Project summary**](greentraffic.jpg){fig-align="center" width="213"}

This project aims to solve the paradox of trading off liveability for mobility by simultaneously reducing traffic congestion, vehicle energy consumption, and emission. This project is expected to generate fundamental knowledge and powerful tools on utilising connected and automated vehicles to help individuals become green drivers. Expected outcomes include ground-breaking models capable of holistically optimising traffic efficiency, energy consumption and emission, and innovative control strategies and policies that focus on energy efficiency and environment protection. This research will bring a wide range of substantial national benefits related to mobility, public health, environmental protection, and energy security.
